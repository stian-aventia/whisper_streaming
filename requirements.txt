# Core runtime dependencies

## Removed sentence segmentation dependencies (mosestokenizer, wtpsplit, tokenize-uk) after dropping sentence trimming mode.

# Optional / nice-to-have (not currently imported directly)
# tiktoken  # (not required unless re-introducing openai-whisper or token cost est.)
# numba     # (librosa may pull it transitively; keep unpinned unless explicitly used)
# tqdm      # (progress bars; currently unused)
# more-itertools  # (unused)
hf_xet    # (installed previously; not used in code)
# openai-whisper  # (replaced by faster-whisper backend)

# Dev / tooling (uncomment as needed)
# pytest
# black
# ruff

# Notes:
# - GPU acceleration for faster-whisper handled internally via ctranslate2; no torch dependency required.
# - Keep openai package for remote API backend (OpenaiApiASR).
# - Consider moving optional groups into extras via pyproject.toml in future.
