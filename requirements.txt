# Core runtime dependencies
# Pin minimally (major.minor) for stability; adjust as needed.
numpy>=1.26
faster-whisper>=1.0.0
soundfile>=0.12  # retained (OpenAI API WAV buffer)
openai>=1.0.0
hf_xet  # required by faster-whisper for model download/storage
Setuptools<81  # temporary pin: avoid pkg_resources deprecation warning from ctranslate2 dependency

# Dev / tooling (uncomment as needed)
# pytest
# black
# ruff

# Notes:
# - GPU acceleration for faster-whisper handled internally via ctranslate2; no torch dependency required.
# - Keep openai package for remote API backend (OpenaiApiASR).
# - Consider moving optional groups into extras via pyproject.toml in future.
